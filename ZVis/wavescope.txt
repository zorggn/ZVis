-- Input
	-- SoundData[]           -- List of SoundData object references that we visualize. (order is important)
	-- PlaybackPtr[]         -- Function that points to the current samplepoint. (Object:tell('samples'), whether Source or not.)

-- Logic
	-- _LastPlaybackPtr[]    -- Where PlaybackPtr of SoundDatas were in the previous cycle.

	-- BlockRate             -- How many Blocks/second to process.
	-- BlockSize             -- How many smp-s are used to calculate the result in one Block.
	-- BlockCount            -- How many elements are in the Buffers; recalculated when setting either Width or BlockSpacing.
	-- BlockMode             -- Signed, Unsigned, Mirrored.
	-- BlockFunction         -- Min, Max, Avg, Rms, Rnd.

	-- _BufferElapsed[]      -- Counts DC points, resets on non-0, hides output after BufferHideTime.
	-- BufferHideTime        -- "Collapse" tracks that are DC after this much time.

	-- BufferPtr             -- Points to current element of buffers. Only one.
	-- BufferP[]              -- List of buffers; contains non-negative smp-s.
	-- BufferN[]             -- List of buffers; contains non-positive smp-s.

-- Graphics
	-- left                  -- Left offset of window.
	-- Top                   -- Top offset of window.
	-- Width                 -- Width of window.
	-- Height                -- Height of window.

	-- ColorTypes
		-- Background       -- Everything not a signal. (Transparency supported)
		-- Baseline         -- Middlepoint of a channel (DC), between positive and negative phase areas.
		-- Line_            -- Color for graph outlines. (Paralell / Trail)
		-- Fill_            -- Color for fills from DC to points. (Perpendicular / Star)
			-- Positive         -- Color for signed mode, positive phase.
			-- Negative         -- Color for signed mode, negative phase.
			-- Unsigned         -- Color for unsigned mode.
			-- Mirrored         -- Color for mirrored mode.
	-- ColorModes
		-- Simple        -- Specific color.
		-- Brightness    -- Spectral Centroid HSL with max lightness.
		-- Mood          -- Spectral Centroid HSL with lightness being total power over the spectrum.




	-- BlockSpacing          -- Self-Explanatory; recalculated when setting either Width or BlockCount.
	-- RenderMode            -- Line, Bar, Point.
	-- RenderFilled          -- Bool, Lines become Polygons, Bars gets an "outline", Points get 3 options below.
	-- PointCircled          -- Draws filled circles on exact samplepoint locations when wf. is zoomed in above 1.0 Block/px.
	-- PointTrail            -- Draws lines between consecutive points.
	-- PointStar             -- Draws lines perpendicular to the time axis, from DC to points.

	-- Interpolation         -- None, Nearest, Linear, Cubic, Hermite.

	-- ChannelMode           -- Separated, Overlay, Additive, Difference.
	-- RenderChannelOrder    -- Specifies the order of separate buffers that are drawn.

	-- ScanMode              -- Scan, Sweep, Scroll.
	-- RenderInvertDirection -- If true, time-axis directions are mirrored.
	-- RenderInvertPhase     -- If true, value-axis directions are mirrored within channels.
	-- _InverseSweepCycle    -- If true, current cycle will go in reverse.

	-- PinchTreshold         -- [0.0-1.0] The distance from both ends to the centre where a pinching effect will be applied to the
                             -- displayed waveform. 0.0 means no pinch, 1.0 means pinch from center. (Static, invariant of ScanMode)
    -- PinchFunction         -- Linear, ... basically tween-like shapes.

-- Extra methods
	-- update()               -- Pull style.
	-- draw()                 -- One frame to the screen.
	-- render([from,to])      -- Push style, can be used to render the whole SoundData at once, though it will be slow.
	-- export(file[,from,to]) -- Draws to canvas and saves the image, calls render().

	-- setBPM(bpm,multiplier) -- Adjusts blockRate to match a tempo value.
